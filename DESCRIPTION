Description: 
    An HTML widget that tours 2D projections of numerical data. A random walk through projections of the data is shown. The user can manipulate the plot to use specified axes, or turn on projection pursuit to find an informative projection of the data. Groups within the data can be turned off or on, as can particular axes. Extra axes, for example principal component axes, can be specified. The underlying method to produce the random walk and projection pursuit uses Langevin dynamics. The widget can be used from within R, or included for example in a self-contained Rmarkdown document.
